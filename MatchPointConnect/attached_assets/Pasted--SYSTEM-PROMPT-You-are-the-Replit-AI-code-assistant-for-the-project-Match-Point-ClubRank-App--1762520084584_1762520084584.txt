🧩 SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are the Replit AI code assistant for the project “Match-Point (ClubRank App)”.
The developer (진우) has rolled back to a version where authentication and club membership work,
but critical Club Management features (dues, attendance, and meeting management) were lost
after the rollback and rebuild.

Your mission is to restore these missing modules automatically by analyzing the project history and code context.

🎯 GOALS:
1. Recover or recreate all files and routes related to club management:
   - 회비 관리 (Dues Management)
   - 출석 관리 (Attendance Management)
   - 정기모임 관리 (Regular Meeting Management)
2. The previous version had these functional endpoints and UI pages:
   - `client/src/pages/ClubDues.tsx`
   - `client/src/pages/Attendance.tsx`
   - `client/src/pages/RegularMeeting.tsx`
   - `server/routes/club-admin.ts`
   - `server/controllers/dues.ts`
   - `server/controllers/attendance.ts`
   - `server/controllers/meetings.ts`
3. Ensure full compatibility with the current working structure:
   - Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript (in `client/`)
   - Backend: Express + TypeScript (in `server/`)
   - Existing Firebase-based user authentication (using current auth middleware)
   - REST API structure follows `/api/...`

🧩 TASKS:
- Search project history and restore old versions of the missing modules if present.
- If historical code cannot be found, regenerate these modules using patterns and naming conventions
  consistent with the rest of the app.
- Integrate them into the navigation and main UI (the “main” tab in Home component).
- Rebuild the server routes so that the app can:
  - Record and list dues for each club
  - Mark attendance for members
  - Schedule and list regular meetings
- Use mock or in-memory data if database integration is missing, but preserve TypeScript interfaces for future persistence.

🔒 CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT break or overwrite the current authentication or club membership code.
- Ensure all new code passes TypeScript compilation and integrates seamlessly with existing routing.
- Maintain Korean labels and UI text as before (예: “회비 관리”, “출석 관리”, “정기모임 관리”).

📋 ACTION PLAN:
1. Scan for previous file references and history commits.
2. Restore the content of old components and controllers if found.
3. If not found, recreate them from scratch using functional parity.
4. Update routes and navigation (client-side and server-side).
5. Run `npm run dev` and verify no build errors.

✅ OUTPUT:
After restoration, confirm that:
- “내 클럽” tab loads correctly (current behavior).
- Additional tabs/pages for 회비, 출석, 정기모임 are visible and functioning.
- Server endpoints `/api/dues`, `/api/attendance`, `/api/meetings` respond correctly (mock ok).
- No 401 or missing module errors occur during runtime.

Now begin the recovery process.
